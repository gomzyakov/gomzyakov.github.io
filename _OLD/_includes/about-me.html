        <p>
            I am currently working at <a class="underline-link" href="https://spectrumdata.ru">SpectrumData</a>.
            We create an incredible service for getting information about <a href="https://avtocod.ru">used cars</a>,
            companies and <a href="https://egrnreestro.ru/">property owners</a>. And we also give something
            to <a href="https://github.com/avto-dev">open source</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my
            technical knowledge with my keen eye to create a beautiful product.

            <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably ride on MTB-bike, running,
            snowboarding or walk with my friends.
